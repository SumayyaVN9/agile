## **📘 MODULE I – Agile Basics & Software Product Lifecycle**

---

### **1. Introduction to Software Product Lifecycle**

The **Software Product Lifecycle** describes the **stages a software product goes through** from idea to end-of-life.

**Stages:**

1. **Concept / Need Identification** – Recognizing a problem or requirement.
2. **Requirements Gathering** – Understanding what the user wants.
3. **Design** – Creating architecture, UI, system structure.
4. **Development** – Writing and building the software.
5. **Testing** – Ensuring the software works correctly.
6. **Deployment** – Delivering / releasing the software to users.
7. **Maintenance / Updates** – Fixing bugs, improving features.
8. **Retirement** – When the product is no longer useful, it is closed.

**Example:** Instagram

* New feature idea → Design → Develop → Release → Update regularly → Old features retired.

---

### **2. Traditional Approaches to Software Development**

Traditional methods focus on **planning everything upfront**.

#### **Waterfall Model**

* Linear, step-by-step method.
* Each phase must finish before the next starts.

```
Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
```

**Advantages:**

* Simple and structured
* Works well for stable, clear requirements

**Disadvantages (very important):**

* **Not flexible** — hard to change requirements
* Late testing → Issues found very late
* User feedback comes only after completion

➡️ **Waterfall is not suitable for fast-changing environments.**

### **3. Overview of Agile Software Development**

Agile is a **flexible, iterative** approach where software is delivered **in small parts** and **improved continuously** with customer feedback.

**Key Characteristics:**

* Short development cycles called **iterations** / **sprints**
* Continuous user feedback
* Frequent releases
* Team collaboration

**Core Idea:**
👉 *Deliver small working software quickly, improve based on feedback.*

### **4. Agile Manifesto**

The **Agile Manifesto** expresses the **values** of agile development.

#### **4 Values:**

| Agile Prefers                    | Over                        |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Individuals and interactions** | Processes and tools         |
| **Working software**             | Comprehensive documentation |
| **Customer collaboration**       | Contract negotiation        |
| **Responding to change**         | Following a fixed plan      |

✅ This is **one of the most repeated exam questions**.

---

### **5. Agile Development Frameworks**

Agile is a mindset — there are multiple **frameworks** to apply it:

| Framework                    | Focus                 | Key Feature                |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Scrum**                    | Project management    | Sprints, roles, ceremonies |
| **Kanban**                   | Workflow optimization | Visual board, WIP limits   |
| **XP (Extreme Programming)** | High-quality code     | Pair programming, TDD      |

You don’t memorize details now—just know names & focus areas.

### **6. Lean Software Development (LSD)**

Lean originates from **Toyota manufacturing** and focuses on **reducing waste**.

#### **LSD Principles (VERY IMPORTANT)**:

1. **Eliminate Waste** – Remove anything not adding value.
2. **Build Quality In** – Continuous testing, code reviews.
3. **Amplify Learning** – Frequent feedback, adapt quickly.
4. **Deliver Fast** – Short cycles.
5. **Empower the Team** – Self-organizing teams.
6. **Optimize the Whole** – Improve end-to-end flow.
7. **Defer Commitment** – Make decisions when information is clear.

**Typical 2-mark Question:**
*Explain any two Lean Software Development Principles.*

---

## ✅ **Quick Last-Minute Notes**

* Traditional → fixed plan, slow feedback.
* Agile → flexible, customer-focused, iterative.
* Agile Manifesto → **4 core value pairs** (must memorize).
* Lean → **Eliminate waste + continuous improvement**.
